Please note there is **1** commit after the deadline. This is a simple merge conflict fix, because the previous commit overwrote itself.
The code on the main branch is an exact copy of the code on the vb_dev branch before the merge. You can check timestamps (or the merge fix commit itself) to prove the project was finished before the deadline.
